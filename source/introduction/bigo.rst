Big O notation
=================

Big O notation is a way of describing the complexity of an algorithm. It



Types of Big O Notations
----------------------------

There are seven common types of big O notations. These include: (orderd from best to worst)

- O(1): Constant complexity.
- O(logn): Logarithmic complexity.
- O(n): Linear complexity.
- O(nlogn): Loglinear complexity.
- O(n^x): Polynomial complexity.
- O(X^n): Exponential time.
- O(n!): Factorial complexity.

The following table shows the complexity of some common algorithms:

Algorithm | Complexity

Binary search | O(logn)
Linear search | O(n)
Bubble sort | O(n^2)
Merge sort | O(nlogn)

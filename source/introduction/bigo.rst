Big O notation
=================

Big O notation is a way of describing the complexity of an algorithm. It



Types of Big O Notations
----------------------------

There are seven common types of big O notations. These include: (orderd from best to worst)

- O(1): Constant complexity.
- O(logn): Logarithmic complexity.
- O(n): Linear complexity.
- O(nlogn): Loglinear complexity.
- O(n^x): Polynomial complexity.
- O(X^n): Exponential time.
- O(n!): Factorial complexity.
